          Otimicar is a solution that converts any car into a smart car.
          I created the server-side services that allowed
          car owners to sync and share their data, receive recommendations and promotions.

          Otimicar is a hardware and app solution that converts any car into a smart car.
          The hardware connected into the car and share the data with the phone app by bluetooth.
          The phone app send the data to the server that generates reports, monitoring metrics,
          recommendations to the customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created the server-side application that receives the customer car's data,
          compare it with other cars of similar models and send reports with recommendations of
          services and maintenance to the customers. It also allowed the customers
          to share their data with the mechanic workshop, car stores and insurances.

            Making possible the customer to send theirs car data to
            different car stores, mechanic workshops and insurances
            and then receive personalized promotions and services
            was a essential business requirement to make the product
            profitable.
            The challenge was that are many different systems used by
            each one of those partners and they don't have any
            standard way of receiving or sharing data.
            Therefore, we had to provide many interfaces
            adapted to each one of those services, even when they
            don't provide proper documentation of how they work.

            We integrated with some key partners sending data
            about the customers' cars. The created service
            was running on Google Cloud only charging on demand.
            The working integration was one of the requirements
            from the prospected investors. Having that working
            boosted their confidence about the viability of the product.
