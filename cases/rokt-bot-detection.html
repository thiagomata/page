        <div>
          <p>
            The bot detection project was developed to identify and block
            malicious bots that were affecting the company's revenue,
            the customer experience and the performance of the platform.
            This evaluation needs to be done in real-time, to avoid
            affecting the user experience. We also need to store the
            explanation of each decision as a way to audit the system.
            A rule engine needs to be developed to allow the company
            to create and evaluate new rules without affecting 
            the customer experience.

        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            The Bot Detection project monitors all the public requests
            to the company's platform, identifying and blocking malicious
            bots in real-time. This project has a significant impact on
            the company's requests and revenue, as it blocks malicious
            bots that were creating many fake transactions, affecting
            client's campaigns performance. With the new reports, the
            company can detect new patterns, propose new rules,
            measure the impact of them, and keep improving the system.
