It should also be used to define the target audience's demographics, create the microtargeting campaigns, and consume the data from the different sources to create the statistics and reports. The clients could extract reports with insights from the data and use them to improve their campaigns and products. | <img width="1000px" src="../img/library.jpg"> |
