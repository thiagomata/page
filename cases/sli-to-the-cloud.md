SLI-Systems is a technology company specializing in helpind e-commerce companies to improve their search and navigation experience. The company was founded in 2001 and has offices in New Zealand, Australia, United States, United Kingdom, and Japan. SLI-Systems has over 1,000 customers worldwide, including Staples, Office Depot, and Harry & David.

I worked at SLI-Systems as Senior Data Engineer for one and half year. My work consisted in developing new AI products, by translating the models from the Data Scientist to SQL and Spark Streaming, and migrating the existing products to the cloud.

## To the Cloud

| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
|--------|--------|
| The company decided to migrate the main services to the Google Cloud. That required rewrite the services from Apache Spark to Apache Beam, and use Google Dataflow to run the services. During the migration, we need to ensure that the services were still running and that the data was consistent across the two platforms. | <img width="1000px" src="../img/cloud1.jpg"> |

## Impact
 
Migrating the services to the Google Cloud was one of the main goals of the company. The new services are faster and cheaper, and the company can now scale the services as needed. Having the services in the cloud improved the company's evaluation during the acquisition process.
