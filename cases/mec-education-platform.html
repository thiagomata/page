          We developed services for the Ministry of Education of
          Brazil to improve the communication, monitoring,  
          evaluation and validation from the government 
          to the students, schools, technical schools, universities
          and educational professionals.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3>MEC / INEP</h3>
      <div  class="content">
        <p>
          The Ministry of Education of Brazil - MEC is responsible for the
          educational system in Brazil and the National Institute for Educational
          Studies and Research An√≠sio Teixeira - INEP is a federal autarchy
          linked to the MEC responsible for the evaluation 
          of the educational system in Brazil.
          They regulate, monitor, evaluate and validate the institutions,
          courses, professionals and students in Brazil.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked at theses institutions for 5 years, creating services
          to monitor the planning, budget and finance of the Institutions
          related to the MEC, to evaluate the quality, frequency and
          expenses of the technical schools, to evaluate the quality
          of the courses of the universities, to validate the diplomas
          of medical professionals, and to evaluate the students
          to enter the universities.

          <p>
            With a country with continental dimensions, the services
            of the MEC and INEP are required to deal with millions of
            students, schools, technical schools, universities and
            educational professionals. Some of these services, include
            charging fees and taxes. These financial transactions,
            sometimes millions per day,
            need to be monitored and validated by the government.
            The services also need to aggregate
            the huge amount of data and provide maps, reports,
            insights, dashboards and alerts to the government and 
            related institutions.

        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            We developed the E-MEC, which is the software for the
            educational accreditation and quality assurance for all
            universities in the country. That software improved the
            consistency, transparency and speed of the evaluation
            of the courses and institutions.

            We also developed the National Examination for the Revalidation 
            of Medical Diplomas Issued by Foreign Higher Education 
            Institutions and the SISTEC, which is the National Registry
            of Technical Courses. These services improved the quality
            of the professionals and the technical schools in the country,
            and also brought more information and transparency to the
            government and the society.

            Finally, I also colarorated with the ENEM, which is the National 
            High School Examination, and the SIMEC, which is the System for 
            the Management of the Educational Resources of the MEC.
