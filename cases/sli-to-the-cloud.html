          We developed new AI products
          and migrated the existing ones to the cloud.
          In this new infrastructure I implemented
          many of the improvements proposed by the AI
          team.

          I worked at SLI-Systems as Senior Data Engineer for one and half year.
          My work consisted in developing new AI products, by translating
          the models from the Data Scientist to SQL and Spark Streaming, and
          migrating the existing products to the cloud.

            The company decided to migrate the main services to the Google Cloud.
            That required rewrite the services from Apache Spark to Apache Beam,
            and use Google Dataflow to run the services. During the migration,
            we need to ensure that the services were still running and that the
            data was consistent across the two platforms.

            Migrating the services to the Google Cloud was one of the main
            goals of the company. The new services are faster and cheaper,
            and the company can now scale the services as needed.
            Having the services in the cloud improved the company's evaluation
            during the acquisition process.
