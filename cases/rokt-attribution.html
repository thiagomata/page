            Properly attributing the campaign events to the desired outcome
            is a complex task that requires comparing a high-number of events, 
            applying different attribution rules per campaign ensuring 
            consistency and explainability.
            Properly measuring how successful a campaign is,
            is crucial to clients to understand the return on investment.
            It is also important to guide the machine learning models
            to better predict and optimize the campaigns.

            The new attribution system generates the matching events
            in a fraction of the time, and with a fraction of the resources.
            It also provides new features to the clients, such as
            better explainability, monitoring new events during the 
            customer journey, consume new nurturing events,
            and the ability to change the attribution
            rules on the fly. Using the new events, the machine learning
            models were able to faster learn and optimize the campaigns,
            improving the return on investment.
