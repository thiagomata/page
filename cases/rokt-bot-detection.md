## Protection Against Malicious Bots

| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
|--------|--------|
| We developed the bot detection project to identify and block malicious bots affecting the company's revenue, customer experience and the platform's performance. Its evaluations must run in real-time to avoid affecting the user experience. We also need to store the explanation of each decision as a way to audit the system. The company needs a rule engine to evaluate the impact of suggested and existing rules without affecting the customer experience. | <img width="1000px" src="../img/bot1.jpg"> |

## Impact

The Bot Detection project monitors all the public requests to the company's platform, identifying and blocking malicious bots in real time. This project significantly impacts the company's requests and revenue, as it blocks malicious bots that create many fake transactions, affecting the performance of clients' campaigns. With the new reports, the company can detect new patterns, propose new rules, measure their impact, and keep improving the system.
