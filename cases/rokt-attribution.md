| Properly attributing the campaign events to the desired outcome is a complex task that requires comparing a high-number of events, applying different attribution rules per campaign ensuring consistency and explainability. Properly measuring how successful a campaign is, is crucial to clients to understand the return on investment. It is also important to guide the machine learning models to better predict and optimize the campaigns. | <img width="1000px" src="../img/conversion.svg"> |

## Impact

The new attribution system generates the matching events in a fraction of the time, and with a fraction of the resources. It also provides new features to the clients, such as better explainability, monitoring new events during the customer journey, consume new nurturing events, and the ability to change the attribution rules on the fly. Using the new events, the machine learning models were able to faster learn and optimize the campaigns, improving the return on investment.
