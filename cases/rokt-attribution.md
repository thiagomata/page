## Attributing Reportable Conversions

| Properly attributing the campaign events to the desired outcome is a complex task that requires comparing many events and applying different attribution rules per campaign to ensure consistency and explainability. Properly measuring how successful a campaign is is crucial for clients to understand the return on investment. It is also important to guide the machine learning models in better predicting and optimizing the campaigns. | <img width="1000px" src="../img/conversion.svg"> |

## Impact

The new attribution system generates the matching events in a fraction of the time and with a fraction of the resources. It also provides new features to the clients, such as better explainability, monitoring new events during the customer journey, consuming new nurturing events, and changing the attribution rules on the fly. By using the new events, the machine learning models could learn and optimize the campaigns faster, improving the return on investment.
