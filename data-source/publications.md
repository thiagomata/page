### Summary 
We published this paper that describes part of a search result, after extensive research in published articles, magazine annals, scientific journal and recommendations of the W3C consortium. This research was exploratory with qualitative approach. The starting point was looking for recommendations on accessibility and usability for the Web that were particularly suitable for 3D Web applications. The demand stems from the medical field that uses such applications in different contexts: scientific, educational and can assist in the diagnosis and treatment indication. This article received an honorable mention in this event.

### Summary 
"This paper evaluates the accessibility of virtual anatomical manikins 3D for Web. Was evaluated the hypothesis of a correlation between the complexity of the interfaces and lack of accessibility of the same. After assessed by the Guide criteria of Web Content Accessibility - WCAG 2.0, was possible to conclude that there is no evidence of a correlation between the complexity of these interface and it's accessibility. Furthermore, it became evident the lack of accessibility of these manikins.",

## [Definition of Computational Criteria to Evaluation of 3D Anatomical Web Manikins for Teaching in Health Science and for Medical Applications](http://repositorio.unb.br/handle/10482/17103)

### Release Date
2015-05-01
      
### Summary 
The use of virtual anatomical manikins has gained space in health science teaching. Its use helps in the study of anatomy and medical simulation of patients with diseases, acute illnesses and traumas. Recent technologies have made possible the rise of several virtual three-dimensional manikins for Web. For the best selection of these virtual manikins for teaching in health science or medical applications, we defined a set of evaluation criteria focused on computational context.

### Summary 
"The use of virtual anatomical manikin has reached within the health science education. Its use helps in the study of anatomy and medical simulation in patients with pathologies, acute illnesses and injuries. Recent technologies have made possible the availability of several virtual three-dimensional anatomical manikins in the Web. The next step was the definition of criteria for evaluation and selection of these manikins with the focus on the education in healthcare or medical applications in order to assist in choosing the most appropriate manikin as each setting.",

### Summary 
"The biomedical repositories have gained prominence in the scientific, clinical and educational. However, problems of accessibility, usability, reporting and lack of customization can reduce the success of some of these repositories with their communities (DUNCAN, 2003). This paper reports the development of an interface with Web 3D anatomical manikin as a facilitator of the use of biomedical repositories. It begins with a literature search on biomedical repositories, being selected the 10 most referenced. To evaluate them, we applied the criteria for evaluating learning objects from Leacock and Nesbit (2007). Subsequently, we conducted a literature review of Web 3D Anatomical Manikins, of which seven matches. To evaluate them, we performed a literature search in which it was found the lack of evaluation criteria to web anatomical manikins. Therefore, based on the usability requirements advocated by Nielsen (2003) and Sommerville (2011), on the recommendations of the WCAG (2008) and on the evaluation criteria of Leacock and Nesbit (2007) and Youngblood et al. (2005), was proposed a set of eight criteria for evaluating Web 3D Anatomical Manikins. They are accessibility, interactivity, interoperability, technological independence, license and terms of use, navigability, realism and three-dimensionality.",

### Summary 
"This study consists of an investigation of the assistive technologies limitations to provide hypertext manipulations at the web environment, under low-vision and blind users perspective. The solution suggested is raised on the context where technical and cultural aspects run into the perception of accessibility and usability of digital contents, and technology is understood as a social inclusion tool.",
