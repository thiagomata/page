This page aims to make nice and easy to show a cv / resume adapting it to filters and level of details required by the user.

I decided to created it, because the current resume tools are too restricted about what and how we can show our resume and the type of interaction and filters that the user can do with it - that is right linkedin, I am looking at you.

To do so, it is using glue and some building blocks as:

* jquery
* chart.js - http://chartjs.org/
* pallete.js
* handlebars-v4
* timeline.js - https://timeline.knightlab.com/
* a facebook template - http://usebootstrap.com/preview/facebook/#
* free images from:
  - https://www.freeimages.com/
  - https://unsplash.com/
  - https://pixabay.com/
  - https://www.pexels.com/
* free icons from:
  - https://thenounproject.com
  - https://www.iconfinder.com

All the resume / cv information it is into the file resume.json, based on the json model of https://jsonresume.org/, so fell free to fork and create your own version of that. Merge request are welcome.
